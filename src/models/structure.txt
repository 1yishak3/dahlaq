SECURITY IS AN ISSUE RIGHT NW. A USER MUST NOT BE ABLE TO GET TO ANOTHER USERS PROFILE AND EDIT IT IN ANY WAY.
THIS NEEDS SOME WORK, BUT NOT AN ISSUE FOR MVP MAYBE?







Add a list of Uids to the root of your Database, it will be much faster to iterate through them and check until the
post number reaches 20 instead of loading the ENTIRE user data just to do that same thing.







 //TODO:


 You need to add Local Forage features to check first time usage and as such.

 Caching should also be a thing, and I think local forage should be a great way to do it

 For tonight, try to get data from the user about their post and add that to your post object.
 will use firebase to send that post to the database, where it will be processed

 Also work on that settings page ONLY AUTHENTICATED USER can access.


 Messages are going to be dynamic. User's side continuously listens to new messages and visualizes the text be typed. Like a live stream. not so difficult
 You can update the firebase info on the go until the typer hits the send button, at which point updating the message halts indefinitely. This starts at the placement of the
 in the text area and ends at the touch of the send button.
 Don't forget the read unread thing. It won't be hard but you know, still.


 All images videos and files are to be kept inside the storage and will be linked to the realtime database
